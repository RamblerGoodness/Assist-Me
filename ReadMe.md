# AssistMe - Your Desktop Friend

AssistMe is an AI-powered desktop and Twitch streaming assistant that brings your pictures to life. Whether you're building a Jarvis or want a picture of your mom to judge everything you do on your desktop, AssistMe makes it possible.

**Please note:** This program is currently in the development phase.

## Features

- **OpenAI-powered or Ollam-powered chatbot:** Engage in interactive conversations with your AI assistant.

- **Function calling:** Enable function calling for both chatbot and user.

- **Pygame integration:** Display and animate character art that moves to the audio it plays. Make the avatar reactive to what is going on.

- **Text-to-Speech (TTS):** Play sound and animations on art. Get text from a LLM to create the voice of your ai Avatar.

- **Customizable art:** Bring your own art to the platform. Make an avatar out of any picture.

- **Twitch integration:** Connect your Twitch account for an enhanced streaming experience.

- **Screenshot and image recognition:** Capture and recognize images on your screen. Your assistant can see what you do. Customizable image frequency. 

- **Memory storage/context-window solution:** Store and retrieve context from your interactions with the AI. Improved LLM Memory that only takes into account relevant information as well as a small portion of the conversation so far. 

- **Interactive Twitch game:** Maybe a chat vs AI battle mode? (Under consideration)
