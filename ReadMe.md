# AssistMe - Your Desktop Friend

AssistMe is an AI-powered desktop and Twitch streaming assistant that brings your pictures to life. Whether you're building a Jarvis or want a picture of your mom to judge everything you do on your desktop, AssistMe makes it possible.

**Please note:** This program is currently in the testing phase.

## Features

- **OpenAI-powered or Ollam-powered chatbot:** Engage in interactive conversations with your AI assistant.

- **Function calling:** Enable function calling for both chatbot and user.

- **Pygame integration:** Display and animate character art.

- **Text-to-Speech (TTS):** Play sound and animations on art.

- **Screenshot and image recognition:** Capture and recognize images on your screen.

- **Memory storage/context-window solution:** Store and retrieve context from your interactions with the AI.
